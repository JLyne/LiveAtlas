A map frontend built with [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and Typescript. Supports [Dynmap](https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap), [Squaremap](https://github.com/jpenilla/squaremap), [Pl3xmap](https://github.com/NeumimTo/Pl3xMap) and [Overviewer](https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer).

LiveAtlas is an alternative frontend which aims to provide a more modern interface and improved performance for busy maps. LiveAtlas is a drop-in replacement for Dynmap; Squaremap, Pl3xmap and Overviewer maps are supported with some additional configuration.

Development is ongoing, but the major features of each map plugin are supported.

You can see it in action [here](https://minecraft.rtgame.co.uk/map/build)

[See the wiki](https://github.com/JLyne/LiveAtlas/wiki/Installation)

## Customisation
The index.html file can be edited to add custom favicons, styles or analytics, just like the map plugins original UIs. All LiveAtlas messages can also be modified here for translation purposes.
You are also free to build LiveAtlas yourself to make further changes.

## Building
This repository uses [yarn zero-installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs), so all dependencies are provided without installing. You can run `yarn run serve` to start a local dev server, or `yarn run build` to build LiveAtlas.

## Support
If you find a bug, please create an issue with as must detail as possible. I'm working on this in my spare time, so fixes are on a best effort basis, but I'll eventually find time for them.

Please do not contact the Dynmap, Squaremap, Pl3xmap or Overviewer teams regarding any issue with LiveAtlas. They will be very upset.
